Visualising prerequisites in course planning

Engineering units often have a number of unit prerequisites. Study plans show the prerequisites and the plans are designed to make sure the prerequisites are met. However, students often take units out of sequence and then realise they have not completed a prerequisite and this can then impact on progression.

Is there are way to highlight or visualise prerequisite pathways A number of options are possible. E.g. If a student clicks on a particular unit in a study plan, can the prerequisite relationships (forward and backwards) between this unit and others be highlighted so students can check the impact of unit choices.
